/*
This problem was asked by Apple.

Given the root of a binary tree,
find the most frequent subtree sum.
The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node,
including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

      5
     / \
    2  -5

Return 2 as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf,
and once as the sum of 2 + 5 - 5.
